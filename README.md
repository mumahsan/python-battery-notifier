Python Battery Notifier üîãA simple, lightweight battery notification program for Windows 11, designed to provide timely alerts without interfering with your system's performance or mouse cursor. This version prioritizes stability by avoiding complex UI elements that can cause flickering issues on some systems.‚ú® FeaturesBattery Level Alerts: Notifies you when your battery is low (below a configurable threshold) or high (above a configurable threshold) and charging.Windows Message Box Notifications: Alerts are displayed via standard Windows message boxes, ensuring compatibility and stability across various system configurations.Persistent Settings: Configurable thresholds and polling intervals are saved in settings.json within %AppData%\BatteryNotifier.Auto-Startup with Windows: Option to automatically start the notifier when Windows boots up.Self-Bootstrapping: Automatically installs required Python dependencies (psutil, pywin32) into a private vendor directory, avoiding global conflicts and administrator privileges.üöÄ InstallationClone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-battery-notifier.git
cd python-battery-notifier
(Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username if you've forked it.)Run the Program: The program is self-bootstrapping. The first time you run it, it will automatically install necessary dependencies (psutil and pywin32) into a local _vendor directory within your %AppData%\BatteryNotifier folder. This means you don't need to manually run pip install commands globally.Simply execute the script:python battery_notifier.py
The program will run silently in the background.üñ•Ô∏è UsageOnce started, the Battery Notifier will run in the background.Notifications: When your battery level hits the defined low or high thresholds, a standard Windows message box will pop up. You'll need to click "OK" to dismiss it.No Tray Icon: This version does not include a system tray icon. This design choice was made to prevent potential mouse pointer flickering and continuous process creation issues observed on some Windows systems.Accessing Settings: To configure the low/high battery thresholds, polling interval, or auto-startup, run the program with the --settings argument:python battery_notifier.py --settings
This will open a settings window. After making changes, click "Save".Exiting the Program: Since there is no tray icon, you'll need to end the process via Task Manager:Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager.Go to the "Details" tab.Find python.exe (or battery_notifier.exe if you've compiled it into an executable).Right-click on it and select "End task".üí° TroubleshootingMouse Pointer Flickering: This version was specifically designed to resolve continuous mouse pointer flickering and excessive process creation. By removing the persistent system tray icon and complex UI loops, it should provide a stable experience. If you still encounter issues, your system may have deeper, unrelated display or driver problems.Notifications Not Appearing: Ensure "Focus Assist" (or "Do Not Disturb" mode) in Windows is not suppressing notifications.First-run Setup Failed: If you see an error about "First-run setup failed," ensure your internet connection is active (for dependency download) and that your Python installation is functional.ü§ù ContributingContributions are welcome!
